# Android App Links Tester


## What are App Links? 
App Links are regular web URLs that can take a user to a specific page/ location in the app. App Links can help to bypass the app selector dialog/ disambiguation dialog and navigate directly to the app improving the user experience. App Links are available on Android 6 and above.

> Android App Links use the Digital Asset Links API to establish trust that your app has been approved by the website to automatically open links for that domain. If the system successfully verifies that you own the URLs, the system automatically routes those URL intents to your app.

App Links which are not verified or properly associated to the website can result in selector dialog/ disambiguation dialog. Below Shell script is to test the app links registered/ associated with the app.
